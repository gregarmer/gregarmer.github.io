      <title>Thoughts on Google Inbox</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an insanely awesome way to work with your e-mail!  Google have essentially turned your e-mail inbox into a massive todo list, which as it turns out, is actually a nice way to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The impact of being behind schedule</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In managing a group of software engineers, this is something that has happened frequently in my team and has been bothering me for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier for me to notice, as in my case, I actively write software with my team.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On February 3, 1959, Buddy Holly, Richie Valens and JP Richardson (aka The Big Bopper) died in a plane crash. Don McLean immortalized that day as &amp;ldquo;The Day The Music Died&amp;rdquo; in his 1971 hit, &amp;ldquo;American Pie&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s somewhat ironic that on February 3, 2010 the last five /8s from the IANA IPv4 pool have been distributed to the RIRs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/2010/04/15/getting-git-manpages-on-os-x/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For some reason the OS X install of Git doesn&amp;rsquo;t include the manpages. Here is how I installed them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was messing around a little with figuring out some of the keyboard shortcuts in Wave. Here is what I have so far:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New addition to the family</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So after much anticipation, many tireless weeks of spec checking and a whole bunch of money I was really glad to be on the receiving end of a brand spanking new 17&amp;rdquo; MacBook Pro!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it has been less than 72 hours this is (so far) truly the most amazing piece of computer equipment I have ever owned, honestly worth every single cent! The initial setup was completely flawless and only took a few minutes. The graphics, resolution and performance are exceptional, in fact I haven&amp;rsquo;t even had to switch over from the standard &amp;ldquo;on-board&amp;rdquo; video card to the higher end controller yet, despite putting the GPU through a thorough beating, testing out the Quake 4 demo :P&lt;/p&gt;
